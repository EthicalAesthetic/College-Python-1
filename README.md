## Mathematical Spaces

The following are important types of mathematical spaces used in advanced mathematics and computer science:

- Hilbert space
- Banach space     
- Metric space
- Vector space
Vector space


2^10 = 1024 bits = 1 KB
2^20 = 1024 KB = 1 MB   
2^30 = 1024 MB = 1 GB
2^35 = 2^5 * 2^30 = 32 GB

 
## NP-Hard Problems

NP-hard problems are computational problems for which no efficient solution algorithm is known; solving any NP-hard problem efficiently would solve all problems in NP efficiently. Examples include the Travelling Salesman Problem, Knapsack Problem, and Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT).


## RoadMap of 4 Years of College (Focus on applications)

1. operating system
   -Cpu scheduling (round robin - Load balancing)
   -Memory management (RAM, ROM, Virtual memory)
2. DBMS
   - Normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF)
   - SQL (DDL, DML, DCL, TCL)
3. Computer Networks
    - OSI Model (7 layers)
    - TCP/IP Model (4 layers)
    - Protocols (HTTP, FTP, SMTP, etc.) 

# 4. system design
