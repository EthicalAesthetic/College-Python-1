## Functions
A function is a block of organized code written to carry out a specified task.

Functions help break our program into smaller and modular chunks for better readability.

Information can be passed into a function as arguments.

Parameters are specified after the function name inside the parentheses.

We can add as many parameters as we want. Parameters must be separated with a comma.

A function may or may not return data.

In Python a function is defined using the def keyword

### Parameter VS Argument
A parameter is the variable listed inside the parentheses in the function definition.

An argument is the value that is sent to the function when it is called.

### Three types of functions in Python:-
 1. Built-in function :- Python predefined functions that are readily available for use like min() , max() , sum() , print() etc.
 2. User-Defined Functions:- Function that we define ourselves to perform a specific task.
 3. Anonymous functions : Function that is defined without a name. Anonymous functions are also called as lambda functions. They are not declared with the def keyword.

## Syntax 
``` bash
def <function_name>(Parameters seperated by comma):
   '''Function Docstring'''
  statements
  return [expression]
```
## Calling a function

1. Call by value
2. Call by referrence ( address in memory )

### Try Catch
 1. throw/ throws (not in c language)
 2. Garbage Collector (GC)
 3. Global and Local Variable
